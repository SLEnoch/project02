							<h2>Experience</h2>
							<p>Photography has always been a passion of mine, ever since my first Sony Cybershot point-and-shoot camera, light pink of course.  As an only child I can remember wasting away many afternoons posing my toy horses outside and laying on the grass for perspective and the perfect lighting.  I would post videos on YouTube of my photos and revel in every like and comment they received.</p>
							<p>As I grew, my passion carried into more practical uses.  In high school I took three years of Digital Photography where I learned the basics of form, composition, and Photoshop editing, among other invaluable skills.  I also learned how to use a DSLR camera!  I now own a Canon Power Shot SX510 HS and am continuing to learn more every day.</p>

							<p>As I have grown, my passion has continued to mature with me, carrying into more practical uses.  In high school I took three years of Digital Photography where I learned the basics of form, composition, and Photoshop editing, among other invaluable skills.  I also learned how to use a DSLR camera!  I now own a Canon Power Shot SX510 HS and am continuing to learn and grow more and more with each click of the shutter.  Through my journey as a Communications Major at Saint Joseph's Univeristy, I now aspire to utilize my photography and editing skills in a marketing setting through digital design and storytelling.</p>
